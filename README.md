# btrsnappr
**btrsnapper** can be used to automate btrfs snapshots of your system. Compared to other solutions this one also takes care about your /boot and /home directories if they are located on a separate btrfs volume or separate btrfs subvolume.

## Installation instructions
Simply clone the repository to your favourite script path e.g. _/opt_. Open and edit the script lines at the top of the btrsnap file to fit your needs. Especially the path and partition labels.
